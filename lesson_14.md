## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Animate SNAP sprites using costume changes and movement
-   Use broadcast and receive blocks to trigger actions in sprites.

-   [Lab 1.4: Sprites in Action](lab_14.md) (Sprites in Action) 
-   [Unit 1 Tips](unit_1_tips.md)

## Instructor's Notes

1.  Warm-up
    - Ask students to complete [Do Now 1.4: Example Animation](do_now_14.md). 

2.  Think, Pair, Share
    -  Ask students to think about the first five steps required to recreate the bat project from Do Now 1.4. After students think about the answer independently for a few minutes, ask them to share their ideas with a partner. Then, ask partners to share their ideas with the class. Point out any differences in students' answers, and emphasize that nearly all computer science problems have more than one correct answer.

3.  Lab Preview
    -  Review the Learning Objectives for Lab 1.4 
    -  Briefly preview the following features of Snap, and let students know they will fully explore each feature during Lab 1.4:
        - Broadcast and receive blocks
        - Costumes tab
        - Sprite Corral
        (Note: Be sure to point out the toolbars in the Costumes tab and the Sprite Corral. Also be sure to point out the difference between the menu options that are available when you right-click a costume icon in the Costumes tab, Stage, or Sprite Corral).       
    
2.  Pair-Programming Activity
    -   Students should complete the ["Sprites in Action"](lab_14.md) lab in pairs.
        -   Ensure that students create two different sprites for parts 1 and 2 so they do not get the costumes mixed up.
        -   Students can submit the assignment using your turn-in procedures or you can check off the work as students complete it.
3.  Debrief
    -   Ask a student to show their solution to each part. Call on a different student (either a volunteer or via cold calling) for part 1 and part 2.
    -   Note any places in which there may be multiple possible approaches. Ask for volunteers to describe differences in their code.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Students that finish quickly can be encouraged to add more detail to their animations, such as sounds, "say" blocks, and/or more costumes.
-   Especially advanced students can be encouraged to create their own costumes for a new animation that does not use any built-in sprites.
-   With struggling students, re-emphasize the fact that each sprite can have different costumes and that changing costumes is very much like changing position by moving. Get students to be able to change costumes on a key press before moving on to the animation aspect.

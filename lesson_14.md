## Instructor's Notes

### Do Now 1.4: Sprite Animation ###

1.  **Individual activity (5 minutes)** 
    - Ask students to work individually on [Do Now 1.4: Example Animation](do_now_14.md). 

2.  **Think-pair-share (10 minutes)** 
    - Give students a minute to think individually about the last question on Do Now 1.4. Then, ask them to share their ideas with a partner. Finally, ask partners to share their ideas with the class. Be sure to point out any differences in students' answers, and emphasize that nearly all computer science problems have more than one correct answer.

### Lab 1.4: Sprites in Action ###

1.  **Preview** 
    -  State the Learning Objectives for Lab 1.4 
        -   Animate SNAP sprites using costume changes and movement
        -   Use broadcast and receive blocks to trigger actions in sprites. 
    -  Briefly preview the following new vocabulary words:
        - Animation
        - Costume
        - Broadcast block
        - Receive block
        (Note: Remind students that they can use the Glossary to look up words they don't know. If you have a Word Wall, point out the location of the new vocabulary terms for this lesson.)
    - Briefly preview the following new features of Snap:
        - Broadcast and receive blocks
        - Costumes tab
        - Sprite Corral
        (Note: Be sure to point out the toolbars for the Costumes tab and the Sprite Corral. Also be sure to point out the difference between the menu options that are available when you right-click a costume icon in the Costumes tab, Stage, or Sprite Corral).       
    
2.  **Pair-Programming** 
    -   Students should complete the ["Sprites in Action"](lab_14.md) lab in pairs.
        -   Remind students of the pair programming guidelines, and be sure they change roles in between each part of the assignment.
        -   Try to check-in with each pair of students at least twice. Each partner should be able to explain their code in a way that demonstrates understanding of the learning objectives.
        -   Ensure that students create two different sprites for parts 1 and 2 so they do not get the costumes mixed up.
        -   Students can submit the assignment using your turn-in procedures or you can check off the work as students complete it.
        
3. **Debrief** 
    -   Ask a student to show their solution to each part. Call on a different student (either a volunteer or via cold calling) for part 1 and part 2.
    -   Note any places in which there may be multiple possible approaches. Ask for volunteers to describe differences in their code.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Students that finish quickly can be encouraged to add more detail to their animations, such as sounds, "say" blocks, and/or more costumes.
-   Especially advanced students can be encouraged to create their own costumes for a new animation that does not use any built-in sprites.
-   With struggling students, re-emphasize the fact that each sprite can have different costumes and that changing costumes is very much like changing position by moving. Get students to be able to change costumes on a key press before moving on to the animation aspect.

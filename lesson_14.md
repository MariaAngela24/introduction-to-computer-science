## Instructor's Notes

### Do Now 1.4: Sprite Animation ###

1.  **Individual activity (5 minutes)** 
    - Ask students to work individually on [Do Now 1.4: Example Animation](do_now_14.md). 

2.  **Debrief (10 minutes)** 
    - Display the questions below for students, and ask students to think individually about the answers. Then, ask them to share their ideas with a partner. Finally, ask partners to share their ideas with the class. 
    >*"What did you observe about what happens to the bats when you press the space bar? Which scripts caused that to happen, and how do those scripts work?"
    

### Lab 1.4: Sprites in Action ###

1.  **Preview** 
    -  Let students know that the sample project from the Do Now is an example of both of the Learning Objectives for Lab 1.4. Then, state the learning objectives and display them to the students.
        -   Animate SNAP sprites using costume changes and movement
        -   Use broadcast and receive blocks to trigger actions in sprites. 
    -  Briefly preview the following new vocabulary words:
        - Animation - A method in which pictures are manipulated to appear as moving images
        - Costume - A costume is one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite.
        - Broadcast block - Code block in the "Control" category that sends a message to another block
        - Receive block - Code block in the "Control" category that receives a message from another block
        (Note: Remind students that they can use the Glossary to look up words they don't know. If you have a Word Wall, point out the location of the new vocabulary terms for this lesson.)
    - Use the starter project from the Do Now to briefly preview the following new features of Snap:
        - Location of the broadcast and receive blocks
        - Costumes tab, including the toolbar
        - Sprite Corral, including the toolbar
        - Different menus that appear when you right-click the costume icon in the Costumes tab, Stage, or Sprite Corral
        (Note: There is no need to go into extensive detail about these features since students will fully explore them during the lab. Just be sure students know how to locate them and ).       
    
2.  **Pair-Programming** 
    -   Students should complete the ["Sprites in Action"](lab_14.md) lab in pairs.
        -   Remind students of the pair programming guidelines, and be sure they change roles in between each part of the assignment.
        -   Try to check-in with each pair of students at least twice. Each partner should be able to explain their code in a way that demonstrates understanding of the learning objectives.
        -   Ensure that students create two different sprites for parts 1 and 2 so they do not get the costumes mixed up.
        -   Students can submit the assignment using your turn-in procedures or you can check off the work as students complete it.
        
3. **Debrief** 
    -   Ask a student to show their solution to each part. Call on a different student (either a volunteer or via cold calling) for part 1 and part 2.
    -   Note any places in which there may be multiple possible approaches. Ask for volunteers to describe differences in their code.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Students that finish quickly can be encouraged to add more detail to their animations, such as sounds, "say" blocks, and/or more costumes.
-   Especially advanced students can be encouraged to create their own costumes for a new animation that does not use any built-in sprites.
-   With struggling students, re-emphasize the fact that each sprite can have different costumes and that changing costumes is very much like changing position by moving. Get students to be able to change costumes on a key press before moving on to the animation aspect.
